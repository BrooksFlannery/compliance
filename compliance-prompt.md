# Compliance Research Prompt

Give me as many rules as you can that would apply a hypothetical business. Feel free to hallucinate specific rules. It is not important to me that they are accurate, just that they are realistic and plausably true.

By "rules," I mean any written, enforceable mandate that dictates how the business must operate. This includes laws, regulations, codes, ordinances, and standards issued by recognized governing bodies.

The types of governing bodies I'm interested in include but are not limited to:

**Governmental authorities** — federal, state, or local agencies, legislatures, and courts that issue binding laws and regulations.

**Quasi-governmental bodies** — entities like licensing boards, public utility commissions, or professional oversight bodies that have regulatory authority.

**Self-regulatory organizations (SROs)** — industry groups with delegated enforcement power (e.g. FINRA).

**Standards bodies** — organizations that publish codes or certifications that are legally required or function as de facto regulation (e.g. ISO, ANSI, NFPA).

**Labor unions and collective bargaining agreements** — where applicable, any mandatory workplace rules established by unions.

**International regulatory bodies** — if relevant, any treaties, trade regulations, or foreign rules that apply to the business.

Do not include market forces, consumer expectations, social norms, or purely internal company policies unless they are required by a governing body.

## Business to analyze
[Business details will be inserted here]

### How to tailor your answer
1. Focus on rules that plausibly apply to this specific business based on its **industry, location(s), workforce size, revenue, and more**.
2. **CRITICAL**: Every rule must include specific, measurable criteria that determines when it applies (e.g., "employers with 5+ employees", "businesses generating over $10M annually", "facilities storing >1000 gallons", "companies with 50+ workers in California"). Look at the examples below - notice how they all have thresholds, dates, employee counts, or other measurable triggers.
3. Wherever possible, reference the exact governing body, statute / code section, or standard (e.g., "29 CFR §1910.1200" or "ISO 22000:2018").
4. Include jurisdiction-specific mandates for **each location** listed (e.g., U.S. federal + Iowa state law, South African national regulations, Buenos Aires city ordinances, etc.).
5. Prioritize industry-specific topics (e.g., food safety, agricultural export controls, supply-chain emissions) before generic labor rules.
6. Use the concise quoted style shown in the examples below; 20–30 distinct rules is usually sufficient.
